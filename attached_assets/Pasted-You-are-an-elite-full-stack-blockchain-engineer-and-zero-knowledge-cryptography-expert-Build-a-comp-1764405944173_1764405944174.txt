You are an elite full-stack blockchain engineer and zero-knowledge cryptography expert. Build a complete, production-ready prototype for the following project exactly as described:

**Project Name:** Midnight + Cardano Zero-Knowledge Age Verification System (AVT — "verify once, use everywhere" privacy-preserving adult proof)

**Core Goal:** Allow any user to prove they are 18+ (or 21+) to any website or dApp without ever revealing name, exact birthdate, or any PII, using only zero-knowledge proofs and a reusable, non-transferable Age Verification Token (AVT) minted on Cardano.

**Exact Architecture & Tech Stack (must be followed precisely):**

Frontend:
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons
- Wallet connection via standard Cardano wallets (Nami, Eternl, Typhon, Lace, Flint)

Backend (Node.js):
- Express.js + TypeScript
- Midnight SDK[](https://developers.midnight.network) for ZK proof generation
- Cardano wallet integration using Lucid or MeshJS
- No database at all — zero personal data stored

Zero-Knowledge Layer:
- Use Midnight’s Compact language to create a private smart contract that takes a user’s birthdate (as a private input) and a public threshold (e.g., current date - 18 years) and outputs only a boolean "isAdult" without revealing the birthdate
- Generate a ZK proof on-chain using Midnight that certifies the user is adult

Public Blockchain Layer (Cardano mainnet/preprod):
- After successful ZK verification on Midnight, mint a soulbound (non-transferable) NFT called "Age Verification Token (AVT)" on Cardano using Plutus or MeshJS/Lucid
- Policy script must lock the NFT so it can never be transferred (soulbound)
- Metadata: { "standard": "CIP-68", "name": "Age Verified ≥18", "verified_with": "Midnight ZK" }

User Flow (exact steps):
1. User connects Cardano wallet
2. User uploads government-issued ID → scanned via third-party KYC provider (e.g., Onfido, Persona, or Sumsub) in a separate iframe → returns only the extracted birthdate (no name/photo stored)
3. Birthdate is immediately fed as private input into the Midnight Compact circuit
4. Midnight generates ZK proof that user ≥ 18 without revealing birthdate
5. Backend submits proof to Midnight network → gets verification result
6. If true → backend mints soulbound AVT NFT to user’s wallet on Cardano
7. User can now click “Prove I’m 18+” on any partner site → site checks for presence of AVT NFT via Blockfrost or Koios API → instantly grants access (no further upload needed)

Deliverables you must generate in full working code:
1. Complete monorepo structure (frontend + backend folders)
2. Full Midnight Compact circuit for age verification (with comments)
3. Working Express backend with routes:
   - POST /start-verification (returns KYC iframe URL)
   - POST /kyc-callback (receives birthdate, triggers ZK proof)
   - GET /status/:sessionId
   - POST /mint-avt (mints soulbound NFT)
3. Full React frontend with beautiful UI for the entire flow
4. Cardano soulbound policy script (Plutus or Aiken or plutarch)
5. .env.example with all required keys (Midnight, Blockfrost, etc.)
6. README.md with exact setup and run instructions
7. Make it deployable to run locally and on testnet/preprod

Make everything clean, well-commented, production-grade, and actually runnable. Use the latest 2025 versions of all libraries. Do not use placeholders — generate complete, working code.
